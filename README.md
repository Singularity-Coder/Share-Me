# Share-Me
Make the best use of your time!

## Concept
The idea is to share your time with another person's time based on your current hourly worth. If you are worth 3000 USD/hr and another person is worth 6000 USD/hr then you can exchange the services of that person for about 30 mins in your time. In return you have to help them for 1 hr on anything that he/she wants you to do. Its like helping each other out by applying your skills without using money. This can be a D-App hosted on blockchain as there is a need to maintain a contract.
